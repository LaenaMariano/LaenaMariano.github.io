## Is Wattpad Safe?

It is not recommended for users under 17 to use this website, but honestly, you do not even have to look to find inappropriate content. Some parents have a joint account with their child, but they will still be exposed to explicit book descriptions and cover art.


## FREE? or PAY?

Wattpad, the online story-sharing community for up-and-coming and established writers, has signed a “first-look” deal with Sony Pictures Television to develop new projects based on its vast catalog of uploaded stories, Wattpad announced yesterday.

With this new partnership, Wattpad will essentially give Sony a heads-up when it comes to projects that might make for a good TV series. According to Wattpad, the two companies will “work together to identify and develop popular narratives from the half a billion story uploads that have been shared on Wattpad,” and Sony will have access to data from Wattpad’s machine learning efforts that help it churn through the site’s uploads, identifying what stories have potential in other media formats.
